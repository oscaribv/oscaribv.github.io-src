### Unveiling the Nature of Faraway Worlds

Since the dawn of time, humankind has been amazed by the mystery of the night. 
A countless number of stars illuminated the clear nights of all the civilisations that populated our World. 

This immutable beauty was complemented by five dancing stars in the sky. 
Ancient Greeks called those moving stars _planets_, which means wanderers. 
Planets were entities of unknown nature, but of great interest for all cultures. 
Their dance around our World should tell us something about the Universe we live in.

Later in time, observations driven by curiosity showed that the planets' motion in the sky is complex. 
Yet, they follow irregular patterns, an encrypted choreography. 
The decoding of this motion taught us that planets move around the Sun. 
And something more important, our World also revolves around the Sun, our World is a planet. 
This realisation unveiled the true nature of those dancing stars: **planets are worlds**.

When we learned about the existence of other worlds, we changed our perception of our place in the Universe. 
By unveiling their nature we will know if we are a common manifestation of nature, or, 
if we are just a serendipitous instant in the Cosmos.

We are now living in a fascinating era in which we know that _other Suns are the centres of concentric systems of many worlds_. 
Planets are ubiquitous in the Galaxy and – we can safely assume – in the Universe. 
The most exiting thing is that exoplanet science is still at the beginning of its era. 
Future exoplanet discoveries will remember us that there are faraway worlds waiting to be unveiled. 
One by one, these discoveries will contribute to the legacy of curiosity, the main distinctive quality of humankind.

### PLATO

I am part of the [PLATO MISSION](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/plato)

### KESPRINT

I am an active member of the KESPRINT consortium since 2016. The KESPRINT Consortium is a multi-national collaboration 
for the discovery, confirmation and characterisation of planet candidates from the _K2_  and _TESS_ space missions. 
Our natural focus is the detection of the most exciting objects, rather than attempting to provide complete catalogues.
