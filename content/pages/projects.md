My main research topic centres on exoplanets, but exoplanetary science is so wide 
and there are plenty of topics to study. Here I describe, briefly, the main projects/teams
in which I am currently working on.


## KESPRINT consortium

There is an intrinsic sense on joining people from all around the world
to search for faraway worlds. 
With this in mind, the [KESPRINT](https://kesprint.science/) consortium was 
created to perform radial velocity follow-up of transiting exoplanets, first from
the _K2_ mission, and now from the _TESS_ mission.
I joined the team since 2016 while I was doing my PhD, and I am still an active
member of the consortium. We have published tens of papers with amazing exoplanets
in all ranges of masses and radii.


## Planet Hunters TESS

Planet Hunters TESS (PHT) invites to search for transiting planets in real photometric time-series observed by
the NASA's Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite ([TESS](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite)) mission.
Citizen science projects are an excellent oportunity to engaged general public 
into the exciting world of science,

I am a collaborator with the Planet Hunters TESS (PHT) [team](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess/about/team). 
We have already discovered some [planets](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/494/1/750/5714758?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
together with tens of [candidates](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/staa3739/6027708?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

## PLATO

The future of transiting exoplanet detection is the PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) mission.
PLATO is an [ESA's](https://sci.esa.int/web/plato) space mission with a planned launch of 2026. 
One of the most powerful characteristics of PLATO is that it the instrument is an array of 
24 independent telescopes, this will allow us to monitor targets with multiple cameras
at the same time.
I am a collaborator within the PLATO consortium, one of my main projects inside PLATO
is to create an algorithm that allows to use this multi-camera approach in order to remove
systematic effects, and provide light curves with _only_ astrophysical signals.


## Stellar activity modelling

_Not even the stars escape the ruin of life_, says Gabriel García Márquez in some pages of the book 
_El General en su Laberinto_. 
I know that these words are true, specially for active stars. Cataclismic magnetic-driven
phenomena on stars affect photometric and radial velocity time-series that may 
contain exoplanet signals. 
It is crucial to understand how to disentangle stellar and planetary induced variations inclination
in order to learn more about exoplanets.
This has been one of my principal research topics since I move to Oxford in 2019.
I have been working intensively on how to disentangle planetary and stellar induced signals
in RVs using Gaussian Processes. 
I have been able to measure for the first time the [mass of a young transiting planet
orbiting a Praesepe member](https://oscaribv.github.io/2019/k2100.html#k2100).
I am currently working on real and simulated data sets in order to understand more
about stellar activity and get more planets arbiting the most crazy stars.
