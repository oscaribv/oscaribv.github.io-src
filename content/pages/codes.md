Pyaneti is a multi-planet radial velocity and transit fit software. 
The code uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with a Bayesian approach and a parallelized ensemble 
sampler algorithm in Fortran which makes the code fast. It creates posteriors, correlations, and ready-to-publish 
plots automatically, and handles circular and eccentric orbits. It is capable of multi-planet fitting and handles 
stellar limb darkening, systemic velocities for multiple instruments, and short and long cadence data, 
and offers additional capabilities.

## [tango](https://github.com/oscaribv/tango)

Planets perform a gravitational TANGO around their host stars which is called orbit. 
If the orbit inclination is close to 90Â°, the presence of a planet orbiting its host star can be inferred
by detecting the periodic drops of stellar flux caused by the planet partly occulting the stellar disc. 
This phenomenon is called transit. If we observe the transits caused by planets in stellar light curves 
(flux vs time), we are able to decode the gravitational coreography and obtain planetary 
and orbital properties of the system.

## [exotrending](https://github.com/oscaribv/exotrending)

The simple, straightforward Exotrending code detrends exoplanet transit light curves given a light curve (flux versus time) 
and good ephemeris (epoch of first transit and orbital period). The code has been tested with
 Kepler and K2 light curves and should work with any other light curve.
