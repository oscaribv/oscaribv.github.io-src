Authors: Oscar Barragán

Hola, I am Oscar Barragán. I am a mexican which once dreamed about become an astronomer.
and now I am currently doing a Ph.D. in Astrophysics at Torino University, in Italy.

I share with you what I have done until now:

My scientific interests are mainly:

* Exoplanets
* Planets detection
* Transiting planets
* High-precision radial velocity
* High-precision spectroscopy
* Bayesian data analysis
* Numerical astrophysics
* Hydrodinamical simulations


## Publications

Some nice planet discoveries in which I have participated are

* **HD3167 b and HD3167 c** are two planets orbiting a bright  star (V=8.9 mag).
  HD3167 b is a rocky buddy which orbits the star each 0.96 days,
  while HD3167 c does it in almost 30 days. The nerdy details can be found in [Gandolfi, **Barragán** et al., 2017, AJ, 154, 123](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa832a/meta)
* **K2-106 b and c** is other multi planet system. Planet b is an ultra-short-period planet
  with a period of 13 hours. Outer planet takes 13 days to orbit the host star.
  Nice plots and description in [Guenther, **Barragán** et al., 2017, A&A, in press.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04163)
* **EPIC218916923 b** is a planet with a size similar to Jupiter, but with a third
  of the Jupiter mmass. This buddy orbits its star each 29 days!
  You can find the technical details in [**Barragán** et al., 2016, arXiv:1702.00691](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00691)
* **K2-98 b** is a Neptune-size planet with a density similar to Neptune.
  The planet orbits its star each 10 days. We calculated that the planet will be engulfed by its host star in 3 Gyr.
  The discovery is reported in [**Barragán** et al., 2016, AJ, 152, 193](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/152/6/193/meta)

## EXPERIENCE IN ASTRONOMY

* **Observational experience**: Multi-band photometric observations at the 2.1 m telescope in San Pedro Mártir,
  Ensenada, BC, Mexico (3 nights). High-resolution spectroscopic observations with FIES at the 2.58 m Nordic Optical Telescope,
  La Palma, Spain (3 nights). High-resolution spectroscopic observations with HARPS at the ESO La Silla 3.6m
  telescope, La Silla, Chile (21 nights).
