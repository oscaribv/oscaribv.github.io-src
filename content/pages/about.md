## PUBLICATIONS

I am first author of five papers in peer-review journals, they are described briefly here:

* [K2-100b](https://oscaribv.github.io/2019/k2100.html#k2100) is a 3.8 R_Earth planet transiting a star member of the young Praesepe cluster (700–800 Myr) each 1.67 days. 
  We performed a detailed analysis of HARPS-N radial velocity observations and we detected the planet signal in the activity-dominated radial velocity timeseries of the star.
  This is the first mass measurement for a transiting planet in a young open cluster. Its atmosphere is currently evaporating, 
  this puffy young planet that will teach us a lot about photoevaporation. 
  Learn more about this interesting system in this [blog](https://oscaribv.github.io/2019/k2100.html#k2100) 
  or go directly to check [Barragán et al., 2019, MNRAS, 490, 698](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05252).
* [**pyaneti**](https://github.com/oscaribv/pyaneti) is a multi-planet radial velocity and transit fit software. 
  The code uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with a Bayesian approach and a parallelized ensemble sampler 
  algorithm in Fortran which makes the code fast. It creates posteriors, correlations, and ready-to-publish plots automatically, 
  and handles circular and eccentric orbits. It is capable of multi-planet fitting and handles stellar limb darkening, 
  systemic velocities for multiple instruments, and short and long cadence data, and offers additional capabilities.
  Learn more about this awesome, fast and totally open source code in 
  [**Barragán**, Gandolfi, and Antoniciello, 2019, MNRAS, 482, 1017](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/482/1/1017/5094600).
* **K2-141 b** is a rocky planet which orbit its star each 6.7 hours! This Ultra-Short-Period (Period shorter than 1 days) Super-Earth
  is the shortest-period planet known to date with a precisely determined mass. 
  Learn more about this planet in [**Barragán** et al., 2017, A&A, 612, A95](https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201732217).
* **K2-139 b** is a planet with a size similar to Jupiter, but with a third
  of the Jupiter mmass. This buddy orbits its star each 29 days!
  You can find the technical details in [**Barragán** et al., 2017, MNRAS, 475, 175](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/475/2/1765/4739349)
* **K2-98 b** is a Neptune-size planet with a density similar to Neptune.
  The planet orbits its star each 10 days. We calculated that the planet will be engulfed by its host star in 3 Gyr.
  The discovery is reported in [**Barragán** et al., 2016, AJ, 152, 193](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/152/6/193/meta)
